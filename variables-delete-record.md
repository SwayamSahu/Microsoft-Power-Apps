To delete a specific record from a vertical gallery in Power Apps, you typically follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Gallery and Data Source**:
   Ensure your gallery is connected to a data source (e.g., SharePoint list, Dataverse table).

2. **Add a Delete Button**:
   Inside the gallery, add a button (e.g., a trash can icon) that users will click to delete the record.

3. **Use the `Remove` Function**:
   Set the `OnSelect` property of the delete button to use the `Remove` function. Here’s an example:

   ```plaintext
   Remove(YourDataSource, ThisItem)
   ```

   - **`YourDataSource`**: Replace this with the name of your data source.
   - **`ThisItem`**: Refers to the specific record the button is associated with in the gallery.

4. **Refresh the Gallery** (if needed):
   If your data source doesn’t automatically refresh, you might need to refresh it to see the changes reflected. You can use the `Refresh` function:

   ```plaintext
   Refresh(YourDataSource);
   ```

5. **Optional Confirmation**:
   For a better user experience, you might want to add a confirmation dialog before deletion. You can do this by using a `Popup` or a `Confirm` dialog.

### Example Implementation:

1. **Add a Button**: Insert a button into your gallery item.
2. **Set OnSelect**:

   ```plaintext
   If(
       Confirm("Are you sure you want to delete this record?"),
       Remove(YourDataSource, ThisItem);
       Refresh(YourDataSource)
   )
   ```

### Summary:
By using the `Remove` function within a button inside your gallery, you can easily delete specific records. Be sure to handle user confirmation for a smoother experience!
